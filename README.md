# Java-Chess-Game

A very simple two player chess game. The chess game follows basic chess rules, does not handle castling, and only allows players to select their piece promotion on the main menu. Available moves, available captures, and threatening pieces are highlighted for players benefit. 

ChessMain.java    - Run to play the game
ChessStart.java   - Code for the start screen
ChessErrors.java  - Code for error popups (i.e. no moves available)
Board.java        - Code for the chess board and pieces
ChessLabels.java  - Houses unicode sequences to be converted to chess pieces
